# HITS

This repository contains the paper and the presentation slides that I created for the seminar "Spectral Graph Theory and Its Applications" (http://wwwalbers.in.tum.de/lehre/2019WS/seminar-sg/index.html.de) in Winter Semester 2019/2020 at TUM. I investigated the HITS (Hubs and Authorities) ranking algorithm.
